				Some time ago I found this on hacker news:{" "}
				<a href="https://alexwlchan.net/2025/bookmarks-static-site/">
					Creating a static website for all my bookmarks
				</a>
				, with a very simple premise: instead of bookmarking articles in browser, you just
				plop them in with some tags and short summary.
			</p>
			<p>
				I liked this approach, and here is my first bookmark:{" "}
				<a href="https://blog.glyph.im/2025/06/i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now.html">
					I Think Iâ€™m Done Thinking About genAI For Now
				</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				(you can note lack of my summary or tags, and that's because I would actually
				probably want to do something better than to repurpose my md-generated blog for
				that)
