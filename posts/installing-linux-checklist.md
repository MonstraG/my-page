This is my personal checklist for installing Endeavor OS on a new machine.

## Installation

1. [ ] Create new [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html) usb drive if don't have one
2. [ ] Check if there is new release on the [Endeavor OS website](https://endeavouros.com)
3. [ ] Put the the ISO, avatar.jpg and wallpaper.jpg (and/or other files you might need, like configs) on the drive
4. [ ] Put the drive in the machine, reboot and choose the drive as boot media
5. [ ] Log in into Wi-Fi
6. [ ] Start installer
7. [ ] Pick American English as language
8. [ ] Select Plasma KDE desktop
9. [ ] Reboot into the actual system
10. [ ] Mount the USB drive and copy other files from drive to the disk
11. [ ] Unmount USB and unplug it

## Settings / Personalization

1. [ ] Adjust display Scale
2. [ ] Disable Mouse acceleration
3. [ ] Switch Global theme from godawful EndeavourOS to plain Breeze Dark
4. [ ] Enable Night light
5. [ ] Change Region & Language settings to preferred, like Language: American English and norsk bokmÃ¥l for everything else. You might wanna enable the locale in `/etc/locale-gen` and run `locale-gen`, see more on [locale page on arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Locale)
6. [ ] Reboot after changing language settings
7. [ ] (if it's a laptop) Set charge limits in Power Management > Advanced Power settings
8. [ ] Set profile picture for your profile
9. [ ] Set wallpaper in Login screen (SDDM)
10. [ ] Set wallpaper everywhere else by right-clicking the file
11. [ ] Change cursor size to 36 in Colors & Themes > Global Theme > Cursors
12. [ ] Disable bell in Accessibility > System bell > Audible bell
13. [ ] Enable cursor shake in Accessibility > Shake Cursor and magnification as high as it can go, it's hilarious!
14. [ ] Disable hot corner in Screen Edges
15. [ ] Add desired keyboard layouts (don't forget to change the shortcut)
16. [ ] Enable compose key in Keyboard > Key Bindings
17. [ ] Launch Spectacle and configure saving to clipboard and folder
18. [ ] Change home Wi-Fi firewall group to trusted
19. [ ] Disable "Do not disturb" on fullscreen apps

## Taskbar:

1. [ ] Remove margin spacer thing
2. [ ] Add Weather Report plugin on the panel
3. [ ] Set Show temperature in the plugin
4. [ ] Set Show battery percentage on icon (if it's a laptop)
5. [ ] Configure digital clock: ISO date, always show seconds, show week numbers
