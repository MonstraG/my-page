Randall Munroe, author of an excellent "blog" [what-if](https://what-if.xkcd.com) has come up with this joke list of things
you should not do in his latest book, [what if? 2](https://xkcd.com/what-if-2) (latest at the time of writing).

The list is on the cover picture:

```
Things you should not do

#156,830 Build a rocket out of old tires and try to launch it
#156,831 Try to swim across the pacific ocean
#156,832 Stick your hand in the particle accelerator
...
```

I think, the list makes first appearance in the blog itself, and gets gradually expanded in some of the articles and then the books.

Now, I bought the book and came across the list in the book and found it very amusing, and come up with a great idea:
why not compile/generate a similar list and put it online.

I would need to think about where to get more entries from, maybe there are more pieces online?..

...

Of course, somebody already made AI-generated, every-day-updated version of this very list.
