Some time ago I found this on hacker news: [Creating a static website for all my bookmarks](https://alexwlchan.net/2025/bookmarks-static-site/), with a very simple premise: instead of bookmarking articles in browser, you just plop them in with some tags and short summary.

I liked this approach, and here is my first bookmark: [I Think Iâ€™m Done Thinking About genAI For Now](https://blog.glyph.im/2025/06/i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now.html)

(you can note lack of my summary or tags, and that's because I would actually probably want to do something better than to repurpose my md-generated blog for that)
